## What is Envycoin?
Envycoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although with many key differences. Envycoin's wallet is forked from Bitcoin 0.9.2, and thus has a build process slightly different from most altcoins.

## Specs

Envycoin specs:

* RPC 9111
* P2P 9112
* 20 ENVY per block for 1st month. Then drops to 10 ENVY
* Every 10K blocks, there is a bitch block with no reward
* no premine

* First "fair ninja"
